    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Sartg MX</strong> ("we", "us", or "the App") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use our mobile application. By using Sartg MX, you accept the practices described in this policy.

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Information you voluntarily provide such as name, email address, or other contact details when you contact support or register (if applicable).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Non-identifying technical information about how you use the App (for example, feature usage, screens viewed, timestamps, and crash reports) that helps us improve the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, app version, and other technical data automatically collected to diagnose issues and improve compatibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Content, settings, and other data you create or store within the App.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information for purposes including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, operating, and maintaining the App;</li>
      <li>Improving, personalizing, and enhancing user experience;</li>
      <li>Diagnosing and fixing technical issues and crashes;</li>
      <li>Communicating with you about updates, support, or changes to this policy (where applicable);</li>
      <li>Complying with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Local Storage and Data Location</h2>
    <p>
      Unless explicitly stated otherwise within the App, Sartg MX stores user data locally on your device. Local storage means content, preferences, and other data created in the App are saved on your device and are not transmitted to our servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any feature requires uploading or syncing data to external services (for example, cloud backup or third-party analytics), the App will notify you and request consent before doing so. You may disable such features in the App settings or via the external service's controls.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We will share information only in limited circumstances, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With your consent;</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations, court orders, or law enforcement requests;</li>
      <li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of Sartg MX, our users, or others;</li>
      <li>When aggregated and anonymized — we may share non-identifiable usage statistics publicly or with partners.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may use third-party libraries or SDKs for functionality such as analytics or crash reporting. These third parties may collect limited technical data according to their privacy policies. We aim to minimize such integrations and will disclose in-app any third-party service that collects personal data.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect data stored within the App and any data transmitted with your consent. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>

    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
